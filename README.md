An AI-powered sports platform that provides players and coaches with automatic technique analysis and summarised learning reports for individuals and groups.
This project was undertaken as my final year project during my BSc degree in Computer Science in UCC.

## Description
An iOS mobile app that provides a sports training platform, where players and coaches can access AI-powered automatic technique feedback, and generate learning reports on individuals and groups.
Pose estimation is used to analyse and detect technique corrections, and LLM's are used to generate learning progress reports.
Details on implementation, analysis, design, etc can be found in the final year project report below. A short demo video is also available.

*NOTE: As the project is still ongoing, the report and demo video are not available yet - these will be published ~ March 2024.*

## Documentation
The final year project will be available [here]() when it is complete. The video demonstration will also be available [here]().
